MARK OF THE WEB ERROR
Sometimes when downloading and launching the project from online sources like brightspace
A error about the mark of the web will come up

Its possible that it is my antivirus or something else blocking it

IT IS A ERROR ON VS SIDE. It is not due to our code


I have only been able to fix this error by unblocking the Resx file through Powershell/ Command prompt
